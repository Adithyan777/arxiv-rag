      "categories": "cs.cv",
      "abstract": "deepfake detection has become increasingly important due to the rise of synthetic media, which poses significant risks to digital identity and cyber presence for security and trust. while multiple approaches have improved detection accuracy, challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across diverse datasets and manipulation types. in response, we propose AWARE-NET - a novel two-tier ensemble framework for deepfake detection based on deep learning that hierarchically combines multiple instances of three state-of-the-art architectures: xception, res2net101, and efficientnet-b7. our framework employs a unique approach where each architecture is instantiated three times with different initializations to enhance model diversity, followed by a learnable weighting mechanism that dynamically combines their predictions. unlike traditional fixed-weight ensembles, our first-tier averages predictions within each architecture family to reduce model variance, while the second tier learns optimal contribution weights through backpropagation, automatically adjusting each architecture's influence based on their detection reliability. our experiments achieved state-of-the-art intra-dataset performance with auc scores of 99.22% (ff++) and 100.00% (celebdf-v2), and f1 scores of 98.06% (ff++) and 99.94% (celebdf-v2) without augmentation. with augmentation, we achieve auc scores of 99.47% (ff++) and 100.00% (celebdf-v2), and f1 scores of 98.43% (ff++) and 99.95% (celebdf-v2). the framework demonstrates robust cross-dataset generalization, achieving auc scores of 88.20% and 72.52%, and f1 scores of 93.16% and 80.62% in cross-dataset evaluations.",

      "abstract": "text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation and user engagement online. yet, despite these advancements, their ability to respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation, and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading content. existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic, pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. to fill this gap, we introduce \\textbf{t2vphysbench}, a first-principled benchmark that systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including newtonian mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. our benchmark employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed. the results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video generation.",

      "abstract": "the success of large pre-trained object detectors hinges on their adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. while fine-tuning is the standard adaptation method, specializing these models for challenging fine-grained domains necessitates careful consideration of feature granularity. the critical question remains: how deeply should the pre-trained backbone be fine-tuned to optimize for the specialized task without incurring catastrophic forgetting of the original general capabilities? addressing this, we present a systematic empirical study evaluating the impact of fine-tuning depth. we adapt a standard yolov8n model to a custom, fine-grained fruit detection dataset by progressively unfreezing backbone layers (freeze points at layers 22, 15, and 10) and training. performance was rigorously evaluated on both the target fruit dataset and, using a dual-head evaluation architecture, on the original coco validation set. our results demonstrate unequivocally that deeper fine-tuning (unfreezing down to layer 10) yields substantial performance gains (e.g., +10\\% absolute map50) on the fine-grained fruit task compared to only training the head. strikingly, this significant adaptation and specialization resulted in negligible performance degradation (<0.1\\% absolute map difference) on the coco benchmark across all tested freeze levels. we conclude that adapting mid-to-late backbone features is highly effective for fine-grained specialization. critically, our results demonstrate this adaptation can be achieved without the commonly expected penalty of catastrophic forgetting, presenting a compelling case for exploring deeper fine-tuning strategies, particularly when targeting complex domains or when maximizing specialized performance is paramount.",

      "abstract": "reasoning stands as a cornerstone of intelligence, enabling the synthesis of existing knowledge to solve complex problems. despite remarkable progress, existing reasoning benchmarks often fail to rigorously evaluate the nuanced reasoning capabilities required for complex, real-world problemsolving, particularly in multi-disciplinary and multimodal contexts. in this paper, we introduce a graduate-level, multi-disciplinary, englishchinese benchmark, dubbed as reasoning bench (r-bench), for assessing the reasoning capability of both language and multimodal models. rbench spans 1,094 questions across 108 subjects for language model evaluation and 665 questions across 83 subjects for multimodal model testing in both english and chinese. these questions are meticulously curated to ensure rigorous difficulty calibration, subject balance, and crosslinguistic alignment, enabling the assessment to be an olympiad-level multi-disciplinary benchmark. we evaluate widely used models, including openai o1, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, etc. experimental results indicate that advanced models perform poorly on complex reasoning, especially multimodal reasoning. even the top-performing model openai o1 achieves only 53.2% accuracy on our multimodal evaluation. data and code are made publicly available at here.",

      "abstract": "the acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is crucial in medical imaging. medical image translation (mit) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. while generative adversarial nets (gans) and diffusion models (dms) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. in fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. here, we introduce yoda (you only denoise once - or average), a novel 2.5d diffusion-based framework for volumetric mit. yoda unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. furthermore, we propose expectation-approximation (expa) dm sampling, which draws inspiration from mri signal averaging. expa-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain mri and pelvic mri-ct - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. as such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. building on these insights, we demonstrate that yoda outperforms several state-of-the-art gan and dm methods. notably, yoda-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. our findings challenge the presumed advantages of dms in mit and pave the way for the practical application of mit in medical imaging.",

      "abstract": "Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering (VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%), and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks, but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory, processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target classification is possible.",
