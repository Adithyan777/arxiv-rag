2505.00312,aware-net: adaptive weighted averaging for robust ensemble network in   deepfake detection,cs.cv,"deepfake detection has become increasingly important due to the rise of synthetic media, which poses significant risks to digital identity and cyber presence for security and trust. while multiple approaches have improved detection accuracy, challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across diverse datasets and manipulation types. in response, we propose AWARE-NET - a novel two-tier ensemble framework for deepfake detection based on deep learning that hierarchically combines multiple instances of three state-of-the-art architectures: xception, res2net101, and efficientnet-b7. our framework employs a unique approach where each architecture is instantiated three times with different initializations to enhance model diversity, followed by a learnable weighting mechanism that dynamically combines their predictions. unlike traditional fixed-weight ensembles, our first-tier averages predictions within each architecture family to reduce model variance, while the second tier learns optimal contribution weights through backpropagation, automatically adjusting each architecture's influence based on their detection reliability. our experiments achieved state-of-the-art intra-dataset performance with auc scores of 99.22% (ff++) and 100.00% (celebdf-v2), and f1 scores of 98.06% (ff++) and 99.94% (celebdf-v2) without augmentation. with augmentation, we achieve auc scores of 99.47% (ff++) and 100.00% (celebdf-v2), and f1 scores of 98.43% (ff++) and 99.95% (celebdf-v2). the framework demonstrates robust cross-dataset generalization, achieving auc scores of 88.20% and 72.52%, and f1 scores of 93.16% and 80.62% in cross-dataset evaluations.",10.1049/icp.2025.1162,2025-05-01,,"['muhammad salman', 'iqra tariq', 'mishal zulfiqar', 'muqadas jalal', 'sami aujla', 'sumbal fatima']"
