When LLM-SL line 2is removed, both WER and UTMOS decrease, with WER being more obvious. This shows that LLM-based semantic-aware learning can provide rich semantic information on phoneme level, which is necessary for clear pronunciation. When removing DCA and using the duration predictor line 3 to provide alignment, we observe a significant degradation in LSE-C and LSE-D.
