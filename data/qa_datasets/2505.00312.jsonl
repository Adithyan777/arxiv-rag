    "question": "Does AWARE-NET use transformer-based architectures for fusion?",
    "context": "The foundation of our framework lies in the careful selection and implementation of three complementary deep learning architectures. Each architecture brings unique strengths to the ensemble. Xception leverages depthwise separable convolutions... Res2Net101 implements a multi-scale feature extraction... EfficientNet-B7 utilizes compound scaling...",
    "answer": "The context does not mention the use of transformer-based architectures in AWARE-NET."

    "question": "What are the hardware requirements for deploying AWARE-NET in production?",
    "context": "32 frames from real videos and 16 from fake videos were extracted and the dynamic frame sampling rate was adopted. We create 30 augmented images for training by applying various augmentations to the dataset...",
    "answer": "The context does not provide information about hardware requirements for AWARE-NET deployment."

  {
    "question": "Does AWARE-NET address watermarking or media provenance?",
    "context": "Deepfake detection has become increasingly important due to the rise of synthetic media, which poses significant risks to digital identity and cyber presence for security and trust.",
    "answer": "The context does not discuss watermarking or media provenance in relation to AWARE-NET."

    "question": "How does AWARE-NET perform on audio deepfake detection tasks?",
    "context": "In this study, we adopted FaceForensics and CelebDF-v2 31, 32 for training and evaluation of our approach. FaceForensics is an extensive manipulative videos database containing both real and manipulated videos.",
    "answer": "The context only covers video/image deepfakes, not audio deepfake detection."
